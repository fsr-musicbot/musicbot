## Overview of packages

- `examples`: random notebooks exploring huggingface
- `musiclm`: the unofficial way to access Google's MusicLM via http and cached token
- `server`: simple FastAPI server, that can do backend operations and serve models locally

## Installing dependencies

1. Put packages to install in `requirements.txt`
2. Run `make install-dependencies` to install them

## Server

1. Run it using `make server`
2. Serves on http://localhost:8000
3. On startup, it will autogenerate `openapi.json`
4. Has auto-generated OpenAPI docs on http://localhost:8000/docs

### Client-server communication with OpenAPI

1. There is an autogenerated TypeScript client that conforms to the OpenAPI specification. Read more about it in [javascript/README.md](../javascript/README.md).

## Jupyter notebook

1. `make jupyter` will start an interactive notebook for prototyping.
2. Alternatively, you can open an `.ipynb` notebook in VSCode. Click the play button, and select the venv for the kernel.
